## Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.

Work in the butter just until the mixture is unevenly crumbly; it's OK for some larger chunks of butter to remain unincorporated.

Stir in poppyseeds

In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla or other flavor, and half and half. Add to the dry ingredients and stir until all is moistened and holds together.

Line a baking sheet with parchment; if you don't have parchment, just use it without greasing it. Shape the dough with your hands into two 5” rounds. Each should be about 3/4" thick. 

Mix lemon zest with 1 Tbs sugar. Brush each circle with milk, and sprinkle the sugar-zest mixture over the top.
Using a knife that you've run under cold water, slice each circle into 6 wedges. Carefully pull the wedges away from the center to separate them just a bit; there should be about 1/2" space between them, at their outer edges.

Place pan of scones in the freezer for 30 min, uncovered.While the scones are chilling, preheat the oven to 425°F.

Bake the scones for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they're golden brown and measure 170 degrees 170°F in the center. When you pull one away from the others, it should look baked all the way through; the edge shouldn't look wet or unbaked.

Remove the scones from the oven, and cool briefly on the pan. Serve warm. They're delicious as is, but add butter and/or jam, if you like.
